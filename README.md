# Sentiment-Aware Stock Market Analysis Platform

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Sentiment-Aware Stock Market Analysis Platform** is an intelligent stock analysis tool designed to incorporate **financial indicators**, **macroeconomic variables**, **technical patterns**, and **market sentiment** (from both news and social media) to predict stock price movements. The project merges quantitative data streams with qualitative, real-time textual sentiment using NLP and time-series modeling techniques.

This repository aims to build a research-grade prototype that understands not just _what_ is happening in the market, but _why_.
